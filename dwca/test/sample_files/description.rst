Description of sample DwcA
==========================

* dwca-simple-test-archive.zip: simple occurrence archive for various basic tests.
* dwca-noheaders-1.zip: archive without core line headers (explicitly stated)
* dwca-noheaders-2.zip: archive without core line headers (implicitly stated)
* dwca-test-default.zip: the 'country' term is not specified in the core text file, but via a default value in meta.xml (generated by IPT 2.0.2)
* dwca-star-test-archive.zip: basic star archive: Taxon is at its core, vernacularnames extension
* dwca-2extensions.zip: idem dwca-star-test-archive, but added the "taxon description" extension
* gbif-results.zip: obtained by downloading occurrences from the new GBIF data portal (DwC-A unofficial variation)
* gbif-results-lacks-s-metadata.zip: cloned from gbif-results, but source metadata is lacking for dataset 5d6c10bd-ea31-4363-8b79-58c96d859f5b
* dwca-utf8-eol-test.zip: For regression test of https://github.com/BelgianBiodiversityPlatform/python-dwca-reader/issues/20
* dwca-ids: The core rows contains unordered ids, for testing "get by ID" vs "get by index"
* dwca-invalid-lacks-metadata: Invalid archive: the metafile reference an unexisting eml.xml file.
* dwca-simple-subfolder.zip: An archive that have all its content under a single root directory. This is probably an invalid archive, but this is neverthless quite common.
* dwca-simple-csv: an Archive containing a single, core CSV file (no metafile nor scientific metadata). Column headers=DwC terms. Similar to SimpleDWC (http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/simple/index.htm) and described in page 2 of the Darwin Core Archive Format, Reference Guide to the XML Descriptor File (http://www.gbif.org/resource/80639)
* dwca-simple-csv-eml: An archive without metafile, containing a single core file (similar to dwca-simple-csv) but also a metadata file (EML.xml). Given this metadata file is named according to the standard, it should be properly handled.
